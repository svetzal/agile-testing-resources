# Resources

These are resources that elaborate upon and distill the ideas Stacey touches upon when teaching testers entering or transitioning to an agile workplace.

## Media (Video / Audio)

While we have 20 years of talks and media, we continually distill and refine our approach as we learn through applying agile principles and practices in real world situations. As such, with media I prefer to share our most recent content is it provides the richest anecdotes and real world stories.

I have included 3 recent links (two video presentations and one audio interview) collected around the large Agile 2017 conference in Florida.

## Books

Over the years, as I've built and coached teams and delivered projects to small and large enterprises, the following highly regarded books have been instrumental in informing my understanding of agile testing practices. The field of materials is rich, but these are my favourites. Some may not seem directly relevant to testing at first, but the testing themes contained therein are crucial to understanding how I believe testing should work in the agile enterprise.
